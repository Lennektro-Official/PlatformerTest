# PlatformerTest

This is just a little simple platformer with bad physics. But I think it's still cool and it is the first thing I created with p5.js. You move with the *Arrow Keys*.

**Test it out:** https://lennektro-official.github.io/PlatformerTest/

p5.js was used to create this project, you can find more abot it here: https://p5js.org
