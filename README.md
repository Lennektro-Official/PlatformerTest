# PlatformerTest

## Overview
This is just a little simple platformer with bad physics. But I think it's still cool and it is the first thing I created with p5.js. You move with the *Arrow Keys*. And yes, it is possible to complete the game.

**Test it out:** https://lennektro-official.github.io/PlatformerTest/
